# Scenario: Take the City

## Setup

- Size: This Scenario is played on a 3' by 3' square
- Recommended Battle Points: 300

For terrain, set up at least 8 pieces of large terrain and 6 pieces of small terrain, representing the business of a city.

At least one piece of terrain in each quarter of the map must be Impassable Terrain.

For deployment, roll off and the winner picks a table edge, having the opponent take the opposite one. All deployment must be within 10" of that edge unless a unit has a skill that alters its deployment.

The winner decides who deploys the first unit, alternate after this.

The first player to finish deployment will have the first initiative.

## Victory

Set up an objective in the center of each quarter. A unit within 1" of an objective that is not fatigued and not within 3" of an enemy may forgo its entire activation to Claim the objective and become fatigued. When you claim an objective, you gain a Victory Point if it was one of the two objectives closest to your deployment edge, or four Victory Points if it was one of the two objectives furthest from your deployment edge.

The first player to obtain 10 Victory Points wins immediately.
