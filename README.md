[Version 2 Sample Lists](ListsV2)

## Version 2, "A time for war"

**Goals**:

1. Achieve satisfying and balanced combat for a diversity of lists and playstyles
2. Include Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, Modern and Sci-fi possibilities from the same building blocks and balanced against each other through costs.

## Version 1, "Get out there!"

**Goals**:

1. Playtest quickly a basic version with alternate unit activation
2. Ensure neither the playstyles of "just play one big unit" and "every model is a unit" are strictly better than the rest
