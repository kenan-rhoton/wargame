[Test Scenario](scenarios/test.markdown)

[Version 5 Sample Lists](ListsV5/index.md)

## Version 5, "Lords of War"

**Goals**:

1. Version 4 sucked so much I had to skip it
2. Simplify Army Building
3. Simplify Unit selection
4. Focus on a good but exciting gameplay
5. Give enough customization to make mirror matchups very unlikely
6. Focus on semi-historical armies functioning, leave magic for later

## Version 3, "A simple plan"

**Goals**:

1. Go back to very basic ideas, and create a solid foundation to build upon
2. Make games take less than an hour and be more fluid
3. List building should be almost trivial once you know what you want

## Version 2, "A time for war"

**Goals**:

1. Achieve satisfying and balanced combat for a diversity of lists and playstyles
2. Include Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, Modern and Sci-fi possibilities from the same building blocks and balanced against each other through costs.
3. Balance everything at the 1K point mark.

## Version 1, "Get out there!"

**Goals**:

1. Playtest quickly a basic version with alternate unit activation
2. Ensure neither the playstyles of "just play one big unit" and "every model is a unit" are strictly better than the rest
