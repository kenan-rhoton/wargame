## Rules

The first thing you do is agree to a Scenario. A Scenario is simply a set of indications that explain all of the following things:

1. What size the battleground will be, usually a 3-feet (90cm) square
2. How terrain will be set up
3. How the units will be deployed
4. What the victory conditions are
5. How many battle points the Scenario is designed for

Once you have followed all the Scenario rules and all the units have been deployed, the players roll off for initiative, with the winner going first.

From then on, players will alternate activating units as follows:

1. Fatigue Check
2. Equipment Selection
3. Movement Phase
4. Shooting Phase
5. Combat Phase
6. Battleshock Phase

This continues until the requirements to end the Scenario are met and the result of the game is then obtained.

### Fatigue Check

When you choose to activate a unit, if it was the same unit you last activated, it becomes fatigued until you activate a different unit.

A fatigued unit has a penalty of -1 for rolls to Hit and Save, and it cannot Run.

### Equipment selection

You must choose what equipment the Unit will be using, limited by the amount of Hands it has (normally two).

For example you may choose to have a Unit equip its Longswords, but in that case it cannot also equip a Shield (unless the model has more than two hands). You may choose for Specialist, Champion or Officer models to equip differently from the rest of the unit.

This equipment is maintained until the unit is next activated and it may not be changed until then, with the exception of weapons with the Sidearm ability, which allows them to be used at any time.

### Movement Phase

A unit may choose to move up to its move characteristic in any direction, both horizontally and vertically.

A unit may declare it's making a Run, and add 1D6 to its move characteristic, but it may not Shoot later in its activation.

If a unit that moves began its movement within 3" of an enemy unit, this is called a Retreat move. A unit that retreats cannot Shoot or Fight later in its activation, but it can still Run.

### Shooting Phase

The activated unit can attack with all its ranged weapons. Each weapon must be directed at a target within range that the model can see.

#### Attacking with a weapon

When a unit attacks with a weapon, all models in the unit armed with that weapon attack at the same time.

Roll for each model that attacks, and every roll that equals or surpasses its weapon's Hit characteristic is considered a Hit.
Each Hit causes a number of Damage rolls equal to its weapon's Damage characteristic.
Compare the Damage rolls to the target's Defense characteristic, subtracting from it your weapon's Penetration characteristic.
Each Damage roll that equals or exceeds that number causes the target unit to take a Wound.
You may join sixes rolled for damage to increase the result, so two sixes can count as a single seven, three sixes can count as a single eight, etc.

When a unit takes Wounds, the unit's owner assigns them to any model of their choosing, but must first assign Wounds to any model that already has Wounds allocated to it. If the Wounds are enought to kill a model, remove it from play and continue assigning the rest of the Wounds to the unit.

### Combat Phase

The activated unit and all enemy units within 3" of it participate in the Combat Phase.
The activated unit Fights first and all enemy units within 3" Fight after it.

To Fight, first you may move all models in the unit up to 3", so long as they end up closer to the closest enemy unit.
Then, the unit attacks with all its melee weapons.

### Bravery Phase

Any units that suffered casualties this activation must make a Bravery Test. To do so, roll 1D6 and add the number of casualties suffered. If the total is greater than the Bravery characteristic of the unit, a number of models equal to the difference flee. Remove those models.
