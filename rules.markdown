# Wargame (Version 4)

## Setup

A Scenario will tell you what the deployment areas and victory conditions are. The Players roll off, and the winner decides whether he wants to go first or second. Whoever goes first deploys his army completely first.

## Turns

Turns alternate between the players.
A Turn consists of the following steps:

1. Check if all your Units have activation tokens. If they do, remove all of them.
2. Activate a Unit that doesn't have an activation token.
	1. If the Unit is in Combat (within 1" of enemies), it may Retreat or Fight. Then its turn ends.
	2. If a Unit is not in Combat, it may Shoot, Advance, Charge or Hold.
	3. After it has taken its action, place an activation token next to it.
3. If the Unit is a Lord or Knight, check the Chain of Command for additional bonus activations.

### Retreat

A Unit in combat may Retreat. To do so, move its Movement + D6 away from any enemies it is in combat with. It may not end within 1" of an enemy.

### Fight

To Fight, both players roll dice equal to the number of models in their Unit. Any successes are Hits. Then each player rolls dice equal to their opponent's Hits. Any failures become Casualties. Remove that many models from the Unit.

### Shoot

To Shoot, resolve as in a Fight, but the target Unit does not roll Hits if it can't Shoot at that distance.

### Advance

To Advance, move a Unit a number of inches equal to its Movement in any direction.

### Charge

To Charge, first declare the target of you Charge. Then move the Unit a number of inches equal to its Movement + 1D6 directly towards the target Unit. If this takes you within 1" of that Unit, you may immediately Fight.

### Hold

A Unit that Holds takes no action.

## The Chain of Command

After you activate a Lord or Knight, you might get to activate other Units. Nominate any amount of Units within 6" of where you ended the activation that are directly under them in the Chain of Command and don't have activation tokens. You may activate those Units immediately.

The Chain of Command is as follows:

- The Lord Commands the Knights and Levies.
- The Knights command their own personal Troops.

## Joining a Unit

A Lord or Knight may join a friendly Unit both during deployment as if during play they end their movement within 1" of that Unit.

To Join a Unit, a Lord or Knight must be in Command of that Unit, and must be of the same Type (Infantry or Cavalry).
So a Knight may Join his own Troops, and a Lord may Join Levies or Troops if one of his Knights is also Joining that Troop.

When a Unit is Joined at any time except deployment, it gains an Activation Token if it didn't have any.

When you activate a Unit that contains a Joined Knight or Lord, they activate together and take the exact same actions.

## Leaving a Unit

When activating a Unit containing a Lord or Knight, you may choose for that Lord or Knight to Leave the Unit. If you do so, activate the Lord or Knight instead and it must end its activation further than 1" from the Unit.
