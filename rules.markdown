## Rules

The first thing you do is agree to a Scenario. A Scenario is simply a set of indications that explain all of the following things:

1. What size the battleground will be, usually a 48" by 36" rectangle.
2. How terrain will be set up
3. How the units will be deployed
4. What the victory conditions are

Once you have followed all the Scenario rules and all the units have been deployed, the players roll off for initiative, with the winner choosing to either Take the Initiative or Give Up the Initiative to the other player. The player that doesn't have the Initiative is the Reactive Player.

From then on, a round functions as follows:

1. Player with initiative activates all his units and the Reactive Player may respond.
2. Once the Initiative Player has finished activating all his units, the Reactive Player takes the initative and repeats Step 1.
3. Once the second Player has finished activating all his units, the Round ends and a new Round begins, with the first Player having Initiative again.

This continues until the requirements to end the Scenario are met and the result of the game is then obtained.

### Units: Models, Teams and Bands

Most Units are just single models. Models, however, may be joined into Teams and Bands, allowing for some advantages and disadvantages.

Teams are small groups of no more than 5 models, which Activate and React together and only provoke a single Reaction. You must designate a Team Leader for such a group, and all members of the group must be within 8" of the Leader at all times. All members of a Team must always take the exact same action and reaction if possible. Any members that can't take the selected action or reaction will simply attempt to remain in cohesion.

A Band is a larger group of 6-20 models, which acts just like a Team except that each model must always remain within 1" of another model from the unit, without allowing for any gaps greater than 1", and every model in the unit must be identical except for the Band Leader, which may be different.

Bands may break up into Teams and Teams may break into individual models (but not Bands into models) at the beginning of their owner's Initiative Turn.

Models may form up into Teams and Teams may form into Bands (but not models into Bands) at the beginning of their owner's Initiative Turn if all the models or Teams involved are in the necessary cohesion to become a Team or Band at that point.

### Unit Activation

A unit may take 2 of the following 4 actions in any combination:

- Focus: Don't move but +1 to Hit on your second action this turn.
- Move: Move up to your Move Characteristic.
- Shoot: Attack with your Ranged Weapons.
- Engage: Move half your normal Move into Combat (less than 1" from enemy Model) and attack with Melee Weapons.

#### Moving

A unit may choose to move up to its move characteristic in any direction, both horizontally and vertically.

#### Attacking

When a unit attacks, all models in range of the target attack at the same time. For a melee attack, a model is in range if it's within 1" of any models from the target unit. For a ranged attack, a model is in range if it has line of sight to any models from the target unit within the weapon's range. A model cannot draw line of sight through other friendly units but may draw it across his own unit or other enemy units.

Roll for each model that attacks, and every roll result equal to 4 or higher is a Hit. The following modifiers apply to the roll:

- The attack is ranged and the target unit is in any cover: -1
- The attack is ranged and the target unit is Prone: -1
- The target unit is at over half the weapon range: -1
- The attack is melee and the target unit is Prone: +1
- The attacking model focused this turn: +1

For each successful Hit, the defender makes a Save Roll. The Save Roll is successful if it equals or exceeds 4. The following modifiers apply to the roll:

- The target unit is in Combat with additional units: -1
- The attack is ranged and the target unit is in Hard Cover: +1
- The target unit is Heavy: Reroll any failures.

For each failed Save Roll, the defender must choose a model from the Unit to suffer a Takedown

#### Cover

A unit is in cover if no models from it have more than 50% of their base visible from the attacking unit.
A unit may be in Soft Cover or Hard Cover.

Soft Cover refers to bushes, trees, and fences, while Hard Cover refers to walls, buildings and hills.
Attacking a unit in Soft Cover provides a penalization of -1 to hit it. A unit in Hard Cover additionally obtains +1 to any Saves.

### Unit Reactions

If a Unit the Reactive Player controls can see the Initiative Player's Activated Unit, this Unit may React. The following Reactions are possible:

- Hold: Save your Reaction for the unit's next action.
- Dodge: Move 2" in any direction.
- Shoot: Attack with your Ranged weapons. Only roll a single die.
- Engage: Move into Combat if within half a Move, then attack with Melee Weapons.

Reactions always take place **after** the action it's Reacting to, but they must be declared before the action is resolved.

## Unit Takedown and Panic Tests

When a model fails its Save Roll, it suffers a Takedown and is knocked Prone and Unconscious. Then, if the model is in a Team or Band, its Leader must make a Panic Test. Additionally, every other unit within 6" of the model that suffered a Takedown must make a Panic Test.

Units that fail a Panic Test must move up to 3" to improve their Cover from the attacking unit or, if they are already in Cover and can't improve it with the move, they fall Prone. Units that are in Combat instead receive a -1 to Hit until their next turn.
