## Rules

The first thing you do is agree to a Scenario. A Scenario is simply a set of indications that explain all of the following things:

1. What size the battleground will be, usually a 48" by 36" rectangle.
2. How terrain will be set up
3. How the units will be deployed
4. What the victory conditions are
5. How many battle points the Scenario is designed for

Once you have followed all the Scenario rules and all the units have been deployed, the players roll off for initiative, with the winner going first.

From then on, players will alternate activating units as follows:

1. Fatigue Check
2. Action Phase
3. Battleshock Phase

This continues until the requirements to end the Scenario are met and the result of the game is then obtained.

### Fatigue Check

When you choose to activate a unit, if it was the same unit you last activated, it becomes fatigued until you activate a different unit.

A fatigued unit has a penalty of -1 for rolls to Hit and Save.

### Action Phase

A unit may take any of the following 3 actions:

- Hold: Don't move but Attack with a +1 to Hit this turn.
- Advance: Move and Shoot or Move and Combat.
- Run: Move Double, but no Shooting.

#### Moving

A unit may choose to move up to its move characteristic in any direction, both horizontally and vertically.

#### Attacking

When a unit attacks, all models in range of the target attack at the same time. For a melee attack, a model is in range if it's within 1" of any models from the target unit. For a ranged attack, a model is in range if it has line of sight to any models from the target unit within the weapon's range. A model cannot draw line of sight through other friendly units but may draw it across his own unit or other enemy units.

Roll for each model that attacks, and every roll result equal to the unit Quality or higher is considered a Hit. The following modifiers apply to the roll:

- The target unit is in any cover: -1
- The attacking model held this turn: +1

For each successful Hit, the defender makes a Save Roll by comparing a die to the unit's Quality. The Save Roll is successful if it equals or exceeds the unit's Quality. The following modifiers apply to the roll:

- The target unit is in Combat with additional units: -1
- The target unit is in Hard Cover: +1
- The target unit is Heavy: Reroll any failures.

For each failed Save Roll, the defender must remove a model from the Unit.

#### Cover

A unit is in cover if no models from it have more than 50% of their base visible from the attacking unit.
A unit may be in Soft Cover or Hard Cover.

Soft Cover refers to bushes, trees, and fences, while Hard Cover refers to walls, buildings and hills.
Attacking a unit in Soft Cover provides a penalization of -1 to hit it. A unit in Hard Cover additionally obtains +1 to any Saves.

#### Combat

In combat, after the attacking unit's attacks have resolved, the defender gets to retaliate by making a small 3" move and attacking back.

### Bravery Phase

Any units that suffered casualties this activation must make a Bravery Test. To do so, roll 1D6 and add the number of casualties suffered. If the total is greater than the Bravery characteristic of the unit, a number of models equal to the difference flee. Remove those models.
