# Wargame (Version 4)

1. Input randomness (no rolls to hit or damage)
2. Balanced
3. Varied list-building (many options both in size and type of soldiers)
4. Focus on skirmish but scalable to battles (as few as 3, as many as 100 miniatures per side)
5. Varied objectives

## Rules

### Setup

1. Terrain is set up
2. Scenario objectives and deployment are rolled
3. Soldiers are mustered
4. Soldiers are deployed

### Rounds

A Round has two phases: the Oracle Phase and the Action Phase.
During the Oracle Phase, many dice are rolled, providing an Action Pool which will be used in the Action Phase.

### Oracle Phase

Each player rolls a number of dice equal to the added Initiative value of all their soldiers.
He may then use any skills that affect the Action Dice Roll to modify them.

Set the dice apart, each player with his own: these dice will be used in the Action Phase.

### Action Phase

Players alternate activating soldiers by using the die corresponding to their Type. They may additionally use other dice to activate certain skills, up to their Initiative value. Once activated, leave a die next to them signaling that they have already been activated.

Once a player has either run out of Action Dice, or all his soldiers have already been activated, 

### Activations

During any soldier's activation, you may take the following actions for free and in any order:

1. Move up to their Speed in inches
2. Interact with an Object
3. Strike at an enemy soldier within your threat range

Additionally, you may use Action Dice to activate any of their Skills, as specified in the soldier's description.

### Soldier Types

1. Command: Rally troops, give orders, often have Action Dice modification skills
2. Assault: Kill things in melee, quick movement, shock tactics
3. Artillery: Strike from afar, establish a good position, covering fire
4. Heavy: Hold ground, Resist damage
5. Skirmish: hit & run, move around unseen
6. Support: Heal, movement shenanigans, all sorts of non-combat benefits

### Threat Ranges

This is a soldier's threat range within which it may Strike.

1. Melee - 1"
2. Close - 3"
3. Assault - 6"
4. Medium - 12"
5. Far - 18"
6. Full - Line of Sight

### Strike

During a soldier's activation, the soldier may declare a Strike. To do so, select an enemy model visible and within Threat range, and count all alied soldiers that have it visible and within threat range, ignoring the first allied model the enemy is obscured to and the first two allied models the enemy is in cover from.

If the amount of allied models counted is equal or greater than the enemy model's Toughness, that enemy model is removed from play.

Allied models with the Deadly rule count for two models for this rule, and allied models with the Lethal rule count for three.


## Rules

### The Basic Check

You roll 2D6, adding the necessary stat to the roll. You need to beat the specified difficulty.

Note how much you beat the roll for or how much you failed by. This is called your Advantage/Disadvantage.

### Opposed Check

You and your opponent roll 2D6, adding the necessary stat to the roll. You need to beat his roll.

Note how much you beat the roll for or how much you failed by. This is called your Advantage/Disadvantage.

### Setup

Play on a 36"x36" (90cmx90cm) surface. Add abundant terrain and choose 3 terrain pieces to be objectives. Play for four rounds and tally kills. Each kill is worth one victory point, and holding an objective at the end of the game is worth 3 for each.

### Play

Players take turns activating models. Each model gets three actions when activated. The following actions are possible:

- Move
- Shoot
- Charge
- Recover (2 Actions)

#### Moving

A model may move a number of inches equal to 4 + its Move characteristic.

#### Shoot

A model may attack with its shooting weapons at an enemy model in line of sight and range. Line of sight may not be drawn through friendly units.

#### Charge

Move 2D6" and fight.

#### Recover

Roll Skill vs 7. If you beat it, lose one status effect of your choosing.

### Combat

Skill vs Skill (melee) or Skill vs Speed. If successful, it's called a Hit. On Hit, roll Damage vs Armor. On a success, the target is Wounded. With Advantage 3 the target is killed.

In melee, if a Hit was scored, the target is driven back 1". Otherwise, the attacker is driven back 1".

### Status Effects

- Wounded: A Wounded fighter suffers -1 to all Stats until healed.
- Staggered: A Staggered fighter is unable to move or use a Shield.
- Stunned: A Stunned fighter suffers -3 Skill.
