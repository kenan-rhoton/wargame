## Rules

The first thing you do is agree to a Scenario. A Scenario is simply a set of indications that explain all of the following things:

1. What size the battleground will be, usually a 48" by 36" rectangle.
2. How terrain will be set up
3. How the units will be deployed
4. What the victory conditions are
5. How many battle points the Scenario is designed for

Once you have followed all the Scenario rules and all the units have been deployed, the players roll off for initiative, with the winner going first.

From then on, players will alternate activating units as follows:

1. Fatigue Check
2. Equipment Selection
3. Movement Phase
4. Shooting Phase
5. Combat Phase
6. Battleshock Phase

This continues until the requirements to end the Scenario are met and the result of the game is then obtained.

### Fatigue Check

When you choose to activate a unit, if it was the same unit you last activated, it becomes fatigued until you activate a different unit.

A fatigued unit has a penalty of -1 for rolls to Hit and Save.

### Equipment selection

You must choose what equipment the Unit will be using, limited by the amount of Hands it has (normally two).

For example you may choose to have a Unit equip its Longswords, but in that case it cannot also equip a Shield (unless the model has more than two hands). You may choose for Specialist, Champion or Officer models to equip differently from the rest of the unit.

This equipment is maintained until the unit is next activated and it may not be changed until then, with the exception of weapons with the Sidearm ability, which allows them to be used at any time.

### Movement Phase

A unit may choose to move up to its move characteristic in any direction, both horizontally and vertically.

A unit may declare it's making a Run, and add 1D6 to its move characteristic, but it may not Shoot later in its activation.

If a unit that moves began its movement within 3" of an enemy unit, this is called a Retreat move. A unit that retreats cannot Shoot or Fight later in its activation, but it can still Run.

### Shooting Phase

The activated unit can attack with all its ranged weapons. Each weapon must be directed at a target within range that the model can see. A unit cannot draw line of sight through friendly units, and it cannot shoot at a unit that is engaged in combat with a friendly unit.

#### Attacking with a weapon

When a unit attacks with a weapon, all models in the unit armed with that weapon attack at the same time.

Roll for each model that attacks, and every roll result of 4 or higher is considered a Hit. The following modifiers apply to the roll:

- The weapon is ranged and the target is at long range: -1
- The attacking model is untrained: -1
- The weapon is Imprecise: -1
- The attacking model is elite: +1
- The attacking model did not move this turn: +1
- The weapon is ranged and the target is at less than 6": +1
- The weapon is Precise: +1

For each successful Hit, a Damage Roll is made by adding a D6 to the weapon's Damage Characteristic. The Damage Roll is successful if it equals or exceeds the target's Defense value.

Any sixes obtained may be rerolled, with new sixes being considered sevens. This process can be repeated for eights, nines...

For each successful Damage, if the target is in Cover, make a Cover Roll. If the target is in Light Cover, any results of 3 or more are Casualties. If the target is in Heavy Cover, only results of 5 or more are Casualties.
If the target is not in Cover, all successful Damage Rolls become Casualties.

For each Casualty inflicted on the unit the defending player removes a model in the unit from the game.

### Combat Phase

The activated unit and all enemy units within 3" of it participate in the Combat Phase.
The activated unit Fights first and all enemy units within 3" Fight after it.

To Fight, first you may move all models in the unit up to 3", so long as they end up closer to the closest enemy unit.
Then, the unit attacks with all its melee weapons.

### Bravery Phase

Any units that suffered casualties this activation must make a Bravery Test. To do so, roll 1D6 and add the number of casualties suffered. If the total is greater than the Bravery characteristic of the unit, a number of models equal to the difference flee. Remove those models.
