# Test Scenario: King of the Hill

Play on a 3" by 4" table, with at least 10 pieces of Cover (combining small, large, soft and hard).

Place an objective on the center.

At the end of a player's Initiative turn, if that player has more models within 3" of the objective than the opponent, that player gains a Victory Point.

When both players have played 5 turns, the game ends, and the player with the most Victory Points is the winner. In case of a tie, whoever has more points left on the table is the winner. In case of a tie, whoever currently controls the objective is the winner. Otherwise, the game is a draw.
