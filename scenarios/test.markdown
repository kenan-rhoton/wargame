# Test Scenario: King of the Hill

Play on a 3" by 4" table, with at least 10 pieces of Cover (combining small, large, soft and hard).

Place an objective on the center.

At the end of a player's activation, if that player has more models within 3" of the objective than the opponent, that player gains a Victory Point.

When a unit is destroyed, the opposing player gains 3 Victory Points immediately.

When both players have played 20 activations, the game ends, and the player with the most Victory Points is the winner. In case of a tie, the game is tied.
