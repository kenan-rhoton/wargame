# Force Builder

## Army Structure

Each Lord can bring 2 Knights, 1 Levies and 0-2 Mercenaries.
Each Knight can bring 2 Troops.

Units have a Class, Type and Focus.

- Classes: Infantry or Cavalry.
- Types: Light or Heavy.
- Focus: Combat, Skirmish or Artillery.

Lords and Knights are Character Units. They are represented by a single model, and may join any unit of their same Class under their chain of command (so a Lord can only join a Troop if his Knight commanding that troop has also joined it).

Troops are the noble soldiers in service of the Knights. They are represented by units of 5 models (infantry) or 3 models (cavalry).

Mercenaries are professional soldiers working for coin. They are represented just like Troops.

Levies are the men conscripted by the Lord. They are represented by units of 10 models (infantry) or 6 models (cavalry).

The Standard Force size is 20 Units. However, that doesn't mean you will play all 20 Units in the game.

A Standard game has you playing at 12 Force points, meaning you can only deploy Units with a total cost of 12 Force points in the game.

To create a Unit, first choose how many Force Points it will cost. Each Force Point grants you 10 Build Points to design your Unit. It's important to make the design match the expectations that the Unit's appearance implies, so apply a WYSIMWYG (What You See Is Mostly What You Get) model to the Unit design.

## Build Point Costs

There are three types of costs:
- Xp: A number followed by a single "p" means that obtaining that costs exactly that amount of points.
- Xppl: This means "X Points Per Level", so this means that Level 1 would cost 1 point but Level 4 would cost 4 points. These Levels are always purchased sequentially.
- Lppl: This means "Level Points Per Level", so Level 1 would cost 1 point, Level 2 would cost 1+2=3 points, Level 4 would cost 1+2+3+4=10 points, etc. These Levels are always purchased sequentially.
