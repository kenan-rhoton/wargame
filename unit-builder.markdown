### Bands and Units

Soldiers (and only Soldiers) can join up as Bands or Units.

Bands are simple: groups of 2 to 5 Soldiers with a designated Band Leader. Whenever you activate the Leader, Soldiers from his Band within 6" activate alongside him and take the same actions. These actions may take them more than 6" away from their Leader.

Units are a little more restrictive: they consist of groups of at least 5 identical Soldiers. For every 4 Soldiers in a Unit, a 5th one is added for free. They must remain in an unbroken group of at most 1" from another member of their unit *at all times* and activate together, taking the exact same action every time. They are also attacked as a Unit. Units have a Bravery characteristic that may cause them to run away. Their Bravery is equal to 4 plus the number of enhancements they have.

## Power Skills

You may take a number of Powers such that the sum of their Levels is less than or equal to the Character's Power Level.

In the case of Units with the Power enhancement, increase the Power Level by 1 for each 10 models in the Unit, to a maximum of Power Level 4.

Level 1 Powers:
- Fear: Cast on a 6. Reduce the Bravery of an enemy Unit within 12" by 2.

Level 2 Powers:
- Secret Pathways: You may forgo deploying this Character or Unit and up to 10 other models. You may cast this on a 5, declaring a spot on the table you wish to arrive at. If successful, deploy all the models within 6" of that spot and more than 9" away from enemies.

## Command abilities

You may take one Command Ability on your character. To use it, roll 2 dice and obtain a result equal to or greater to the distance in inches to the unit you are trying to affect.

Abilities:
- Shield Wall: If the affected unit has Shields and doesn't move, they may reroll both 1s and 2s for their Saves.
