# Army Builder (Version 5)

## Army Structure

Each Lord can bring 2 Knights, 1 Levies and 0-2 Mercenaries.
Each Knight can bring 2 Troops.

Units have a Class, Type and Focus.

- Classes: Infantry or Cavalry.
- Types: Light or Heavy.
- Focus: Combat, Skirmish or Artillery.

Lords and Knights are Character Units. They are represented by a single model, and may join any unit of their same Class under their chain of command (so a Lord can only join a Troop if his Knight commanding that troop has also joined it).

Troops are the noble soldiers in service of the Knights. They are represented by units of 5 models (infantry) or 3 models (cavalry).

Mercenaries are professional soldiers working for coin. They are represented just like Troops.

Levies are the men conscripted by the Lord. They are represented by units of 10 models (infantry) or 6 models (cavalry).
