# Scenario: Battle for the Pass

## Setup

- Size: This Scenario is played on a 3' by 3' square
- Recommended Battle Points: 1000

For terrain, divide the map in two horizontally with a strip of Difficult Terrain representing a river, with three equidistant strips of normal terrain no more than 6" wide, representing bridges.

Then place at least 4 pieces of large terrain and 4 pieces of small terrain on each side of the river.

For deployment, roll off and the winner picks a table edge parallel to the river, having the opponent take the opposite one. All deployment must be within 10" of that edge unless a unit has a skill that alters its deployment.

The winner decides who deploys the first unit, alternate after this.

The first player to finish deployment will have the first initiative.

## Victory

Set up an objective in the center of each bridge.
A unit within 1" of an objective that is not fatigued and not within 3" of an enemy may forgo its entire activation to Claim the objective and become fatigued.
When you claim an objective, you gain a Victory Point if it is on one of the bridges to the side and two Victory Points if it is the central bridge objective.

The first player to obtain 10 Victory Points wins immediately.
