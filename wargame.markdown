## Rules

The first thing you do is agree to a Scenario. A Scenario is simply a set of indications that explain all of the following things:

1. What size the battleground will be, usually a 3-feet (90cm) square
2. How terrain will be set up
3. How the units will be deployed
4. What the victory conditions are
5. How many battle points the Scenario is designed for

Once you have followed all the Scenario rules and all the units have been deployed, the players roll off for initiative, with the winner going first.

From then on, players will alternate activating units as follows:

1. Fatigue Check
2. Movement Phase
3. Shooting Phase
4. Charge Phase
5. Combat Phase
6. Battleshock Phase

This continues until the requirements to end the Scenario are met and the result of the game is then obtained.

### Fatigue Check

When you choose to activate a unit, if it was the same unit you last activated, it becomes fatigued until you activate a different unit.

A fatigued unit has a penalty of -1 for rolls to Hit and Save, and it cannot Run.

### Movement Phase

A unit may choose to move up to its move characteristic in any direction, both horizontally and vertically.

A unit may declare it's making a Run, and add 1D6 to its move characteristic, but it may not Shoot later in its activation.

If a unit that moves began its movement within 3" of an enemy unit, this is called a Retreat move. A unit that retreats cannot Shoot or Fight later in its activation, but it can still Run.

### Shooting Phase

The activated unit can attack with all its ranged weapons. Each weapon must be directed at a target within range that the model can see.

### Combat Phase

The activated unit and all enemy units within 3" of it participate in the Combat Phase.
The activated unit Fights first and all enemy units within 3" Fight after it.

To Fight, first you may move all models in the unit up to 3", so long as they end up closer to the closest enemy unit.
Then, the unit attacks with all its melee weapons.

### Battleshock Phase

Any units that suffered casualties this activation must make a Battleshock Test. To do so, roll 1D6 and add the number of casualties suffered. If the total is greater than the Bravery characteristic of the unit, a number of models equal to the difference flee. Remove those models.
