## Rules

The first thing you do is agree to a Scenario. A Scenario is simply a set of indications that explain all of the following things:

1. What size the battleground will be, usually a 3-feet (90cm) square
2. How terrain will be set up
3. How the units will be deployed
4. What the victory conditions are
5. How many battle points the Scenario is designed for

Once you have followed all the Scenario rules and all the units have been deployed, the players roll off for initiative, with the winner going first.

From then on, players will alternate activating units as follows:

1. Fatigue Check
2. Movement Phase
3. Shooting Phase
4. Charge Phase
5. Combat Phase
6. Battleshock Phase

This continues until the requirements to end the Scenario are met and the result of the game is then obtained.

### Fatigue Check

When you choose to activate a unit, if it was the same unit you last activated, it becomes fatigued until you activate a different unit.

A fatigued unit has a penalty of -1 for rolls to Hit and Save, as well as half its normal movement, and it cannot Run or Charge.

### Movement Phase

A unit may choose to move up to its move characteristic in any direction, both horizontally and vertically.

A unit may declare it's making a Run, and add 1D6 to its move characteristic, but it may not Shoot, Charge or Fight later in its activation.

If a unit that moves began its movement within 3" of an enemy unit, this is called a Retreat move. A unit that retreats cannot Shoot, Charge or Fight later in its activation, but it can Run.

### Charge Phase

A unit may declare a Charge on any target unit within 12" of it. Once it has done so, roll 2D6 and move the unit that many inches towards that target unit.

If this brings the unit to within 1/2" of the target unit, the charging unit and any enemy units within 3" of it roll 2D6 and add their Bravery to the roll. From the highest to the lowest result will be the order they activate in the Combat Phase (roll off for ties).

If this does not bring the unit to within 1/2" of the target unit, the unit may not Fight in its Combat Phase.

### Combat Phase

The activated unit and all enemy units within 3" of it participate in the Combat Phase. If the activated unit made a Charge, and an enemy unit has a higher initiative order than it (or if the activated unit failed the Charge), it may choose to Shoot instead of Fight.

If no charge was made, instead the activated unit Fights first and all enemy units within 3" Fight after it.

### Battleshock Phase

Any units that suffered casualties in this activation must make a Battleshock Test.

To make a Battleshock Test, roll 2D6 and compare the result to the unit's Bravery. If the result is lower, nothing happens. If it's higher, the unit Breaks and is Broken for the rest of the battle (no further Battleshock Tests will be made for it). Broken units have -1 to Hit and to Save, and may not Charge.

Apply the following modifiers to the unit's Bravery for this roll:

- Unit has an Officer: +2 Bravery
- Unit has less than half its original models: -1 Bravery
- Unit has less than a quarter its original models: -3 Bravery
- Unit is within 3" of more than 1 enemy unit: -1 Bravery per aditional enemy unit beyond the first.
- Unit is within 10" of a friendly enemy unit: +1 Bravery
